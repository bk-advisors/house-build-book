You have the vision. You know where you want to build, how big the house should be, and what type of home suits your needs. Now comes the question that every aspiring homeowner must face: *How will you pay for it?*

Financing a house in Africa is rarely straightforward. Incomes fluctuate, inflation erodes savings, and formal lending can come with punishing interest rates. Yet people across the continent continue to build---often through creative combinations of saving, borrowing, and family support.

Part 2 explores the three most common ways to finance your building project:

-   **Savings** --- the slow but debt-free path (Chapter 4)
-   **Loans** --- faster access to funds, but with strings attached (Chapter 5)
-   **Family contributions** --- leveraging the African tradition of collective support (Chapter 6)

Each approach has its strengths and risks. Understanding them will help you make the smartest financial decisions for your unique situation.
