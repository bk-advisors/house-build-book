Matthew Kuch is a Ugandan professional with a background in management consulting and a deep passion for practical problem-solving. Born and raised in Uganda, he understands firsthand the aspirations, challenges, and cultural dynamics that shape the house-building journey across East Africa.

Matthew's interest in house construction grew out of his own experience building a home---a journey that taught him as much about patience and financial planning as it did about bricks and mortar. Along the way, he discovered that practical, accessible guidance for first-time builders in Africa was remarkably scarce. This book is his contribution to closing that gap.

When he is not writing, Matthew works as a consultant helping organisations make better decisions through data and analysis. He brings the same analytical, no-nonsense approach to this book: focusing on what works, what doesn't, and what every aspiring homeowner needs to know before breaking ground.

Matthew lives in Kampala with his family.
