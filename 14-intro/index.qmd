In contemporary African society---the society in which I was born---one of the many unspoken expectations of growing up is that you will eventually leave your parents' home and establish your own. Starting out usually means renting a simple room or apartment. But to be truly considered independent and successful, one must build one's own home. This expectation applies across all ages, whether you live in a rural area or an urban centre.

Across the continent, urbanisation and economic growth are fuelling a renewed interest in modern housing. Many people desire a home that strikes the right balance between affordability, sustainability, and outstanding functionality.

The challenge, for many, is that reliable guidance on what it takes to build a modern house is remarkably hard to find---especially guidance on how to do it efficiently and cost-effectively in a volatile economy like ours. There is no convenient spring of knowledge from which to drink and miraculously understand the building process. And if such material exists, chances are it has not yet reached those who need it most.

That is why I was motivated to write this book: to take you through the journey of building a modern house and, in the process, save you some money and frustration.

## How This Book Is Structured

This book is divided into three main parts:

-   **Part 1: The Vision** --- covers the initial phase of imagining and planning what your house should look like.

-   **Part 2: The Money** --- covers how to finance your building project.

-   **Part 3: The Building** --- covers the different phases of constructing a house.

As I write this book, I do not claim to be an authority on the science and art of house construction. But I do have valuable practical lessons---learned from others and from building my own home---that I believe are worth sharing.

My goal is that by the time you finish reading, you will have expanded your knowledge of house construction and, most importantly, avoided the pitfalls of walking the house-building journey blindfolded.

Let's begin!
