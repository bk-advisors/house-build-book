Every house begins as an idea. Before a single brick is laid, before a budget is drawn up, before a contractor is hired, there is a vision---a picture in your mind of the home you want to build and the life you want to live in it.

Part 1 of this book is about nurturing that vision and turning a vague dream into a concrete plan. Over the next three chapters, you will learn how to:

-   **Imagine** your ideal home by considering location, size, and type (Chapter 1)
-   **Research and consult** so that your plans are grounded in reality, not just aspiration (Chapter 2)
-   **Plan your resources**---people, time, and money---so that you are prepared for the road ahead (Chapter 3)

The time you invest in this planning phase will pay dividends throughout the rest of your building journey. A well-thought-out vision is the foundation upon which everything else is built.
