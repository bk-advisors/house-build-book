Every person who has ever built a house in Africa has a story to tell. Some of those stories are triumphant---tales of perseverance, careful planning, and the joy of finally turning a key in one's own front door. Others are cautionary---stories of budgets that spiralled out of control, walls that cracked before the paint dried, and projects that stalled for years, becoming monuments to good intentions and poor preparation.

I have heard both kinds of stories. I have lived some of them.

When I set out to build my own home, I quickly discovered that the knowledge I needed was scattered across conversations with friends, advice from contractors of varying reliability, and hard lessons learned through trial and error. There was no single, accessible guide that spoke to the realities of building in our context---the fluctuating material costs, the seasonal rains that halt construction, the delicate art of managing family expectations, and the sheer determination required to see a project through to completion.

This book is my attempt to fill that gap.

I do not claim to be an architect, an engineer, or a construction expert. What I offer instead is something that I believe is equally valuable: the perspective of someone who has walked this path, made mistakes, learned from others, and emerged with practical lessons worth sharing. I have spoken with dozens of homeowners, builders, and professionals across Uganda to ensure that the advice in these pages is grounded in real experience.

My hope is simple: that this book saves you time, money, and frustration. That it gives you the confidence to ask the right questions, make informed decisions, and avoid the pitfalls that trip up so many first-time builders. And most of all, that it brings you one step closer to standing on the verandah of a home that is truly your own.

The journey of building a house is long, but every great journey begins with a single step. Consider this book your first step.
