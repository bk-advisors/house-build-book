The planning is done. The money is in place. Now it is time to build.

This is the phase that most people look forward to---the tangible, visible progress of walls rising from the ground and a roof taking shape against the sky. But it is also the phase where the most can go wrong. Rushed decisions, poor materials, and inexperienced labour can turn your dream project into an expensive headache.

Part 3 walks you through the three main stages of physical construction:

-   **Sub-structure** --- everything below ground level: excavation, foundations, and damp-proofing (Chapter 7)
-   **Super-structure** --- everything above ground: walls, columns, beams, roofing, windows, and doors (Chapter 8)
-   **Finishings** --- the details that transform a shell into a home: plastering, painting, flooring, electrical, plumbing, and external works (Chapter 9)

Each stage builds upon the last. Get the foundation right, and the rest follows. Cut corners early, and you will pay for it later. The chapters ahead will show you how to navigate each stage wisely.
